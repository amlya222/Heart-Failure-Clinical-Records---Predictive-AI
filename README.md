🫀 Heart Failure Clinical Records - Predictive AI
This project aims to develop a predictive AI model that can analyze patient clinical data and assess the risk of heart failure. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide early warnings and assist healthcare professionals in taking preventive actions.

📌 Project Objective
To build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model using heart failure clinical records to:

Predict the probability of heart failure events.

Identify critical clinical features that contribute to heart health.

Assist doctors and healthcare professionals in decision-making.
